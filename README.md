# Just-A-Few-Brews-Finder

## User Story
As an Alcoholic Kanye Fan, I would like to search for Breweries based on State, City or Zipcode so I can navigate my way to a new brewery.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a Brewery dashboard with form inputs

WHEN I search for a City
THEN I am presented with Breweries from that city along with a Kanye Quote and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I search for a State
THEN I am presented with Breweries from that state along with a Kanye Quote and that State is added to the search history

WHEN I search for a Zip Code
THEN I am presented with Breweries from that Zip Code along with a Kanye Quote and that Zip Code is added to the search history

WHEN I search for a Brewery Name
THEN I am presented with possible Matching Breweries with a complete address and link to their website along with a Kanye Quote. And this is added to the search history

WHEN no results are returned
THEN a "How sway?!" gif is displayed
